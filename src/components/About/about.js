        I'm a passionate full-stack developer immersed in the world of software
        development. Along my academic journey, I uncovered a profound interest
        in coding and software design, propelling me towards self-study and
        personal projects within the software realm. Armed with 1 year of
        experience as a frontend developer, I'm eager about applying my
