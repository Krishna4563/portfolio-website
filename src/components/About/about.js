        I'm a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate looking to transition into
        the software field with a strong passion and dedication towards software
        development. My academic journey ignited my interest in coding and
        software design, leading me to pursue independent study and build
        personal software projects that are user friendly. I'm eager to apply my
        problem-solving skills and technical knowledge to innovative software
        projects. My expertise includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the MERN stack
        (React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js) for web application
        development. My commitment to staying current with industry trends and
        my ability to collaborate effectively make me a valuable asset to any
        development team. I'm excited to bring my enthusiasm and skills to a
        software development team, as I'm genuinely eager to contribute and
        learn in a collaborative work environment.
